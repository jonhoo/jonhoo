I build stuff and teach things. I'm currently a Principal Engineer at [Helsing](https://helsing.ai/), working on safety-critical systems in Rust. Previously. I maintained the Rust build infrastructure at AWS and I co-founded [ReadySet](https://readyset.io/), which is building a commercial offering of my PhD thesis database [Noria](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria). I maintain a bunch of Rust crates (see pinned repos).

When I'm not writing code, I'm often writing or talking *about* code:
I wrote [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/)
and am a co-instructor of MIT's [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).
I also make educational Rust videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@jonhoo)
and co-host [Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/).

You can find announcements about upcoming streams, talks, etc. on [my Discord server](https://discord.jonhoo.eu/).
